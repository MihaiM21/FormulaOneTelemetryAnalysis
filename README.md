## About FOTA




The purpouse of this application is to generate plots & graphs with telemetry data from Formula One cars. In the future I will try to develop an android and windows app with simple GUI and more features.


## How to use:

- Run "program.py"

- Select the year, plot type (some need drivers and teams), event (
    - "R" -> race
    - "S" -> sprint race
    - "Q" -> qualifying
    - "SQ" -> sprint qualifying
    - "FP1"/"FP2"/"FP3" -> Free practice 1/2/3
)

- Click on execute and open the file in the "plots" folder
